            <p>
               Since beginning my journey as a freelance designer over 11 years,
               I've done remote work for agencies, consulted for startups, and
               collaborated with talented people to create digital products for
               both business and consumer use. I'm quietly confident, naturally
               curious, and perpetually working on improving my chops one design
               problem at a time.
